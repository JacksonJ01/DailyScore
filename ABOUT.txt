Create a program that will keep track of my score each day
At the end of the week the program will tell me if I did better than the last week
If they reach the weekly treshold they set, they will get the prize they set
#
The user will be able to create a new file and name it
There will be a file holding the names of files to check if that file exists.
The user can give the create as many tasks as they want and will be able to name them
    Each task will have the if no option, meaning if the task wasn't completed you can still get some points for sub tasks
Each main task will have points assigned to them as well, and those points will be added to a list that will be used to find the maximum number of points per day
The user can set a weekly point goal, and if they reach it, they get a prize, one that they set for themselves
#
If an existing user, the program will ask for the name of the file
Once in, the user will be able to:
Add tasks    (In the future)
Delete tasks (In the future)
Update goal number
Update prize
#
The file will be separated by weeks
Each week will start on Sunday and end on Saturday
The program will check the file for the last login date then see how much time has passed
Users will have 24 hours to input data
    Might allow user to set the "reset" time for the day
If only a day has passed the program will ask you questions for the current day
 I can ask the user if the day is over. If so, they can enter data
                                        If not, they can't enter the data
If you've missed a day you will be able to input data for both that day and the current day
If you miss more than one day the program will put a zero in for all of the days you missed that week
